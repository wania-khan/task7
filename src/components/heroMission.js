       We strive to be much more than just a software, technology, or data company.
       Yes - each of those are incredibly powerful tools for changing the lives of our local-service 
       small business customers and partners, but they alone aren&apos;t enough to truly innovate on a centuries old industry. 
       To revolutionize on how we help businesses grow and scale, we have to do much more than simply provide technology and know-how. 
       We have to enable our customers with anything and everything they may need to take their
       businesses to the next level, whether it be technology-based or otherwise.
